<h3>Events are an Adapted Solution</h3>
<p>Events are oftentimes used within applications to allow cross-module communication without creating unnecessary dependencies. Unnecessary dependencies occur when modules rely on the functionality of other modules to perform their own set of tasks. Events are one implementation of the broader idea of functional decoupling, however they are not always the best option to achieve decoupling IMO.
</p>

<p>Here are a few issues with using events to functionally decouple an application&#39;s modules:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Debugging tools cannot trace publishers to subscribers.</em><p>The stack trace of an error will report back to the subscription, but not to the publisher.</li>
	<li><em>Lint tools cannot check for incorrect namespacing.</em><p>Events are namespaced with strings, therefore invalid publishers or subscribers are invisible to lint tool checks.</p>
	<li><em>Forsight of the entire application is required when creating modules.</em><p>Although modules are functionally decoupled, the developers of each module must still be aware of what events they must publish and subscribe to.</p></li>
	<li><em>Logical redundancy at the source.</em><p>Events require that the source of a task is modified to communicate that the task was complete. This leads to semantic redundancy.</p></li>
</ul>
	
<p>Via the &ldquo;pub-sub&rdquo; pattern, events often indicate that some public method of a module was invoked within an application. Now, this is not always true, considering the case of asynchronous callbacks:</p>

	<pre>
		<code class="coffeescript">resource().done (data) ->

	updateModel data

	eventsAggregator.trigger 'modelUpdated'
</code>
	</pre>

<p>
	But in testable, well-written modules, the tasks of the module are published as properties on the module itself. In the case of asynchronous callbacks, the data obtained from a resource is passed to a public method.
</p>

	<pre>
		<code class="coffeescript">resource().done @updateModel</code>
	</pre>

<p>
	Therefore the intention of the developer in using events is simply to communicate from module A to module B that some method, i.e. <span class="code">A.updateModel</span> was invoked.
</p>
<h3>Enter Simple AOP Proxies</h3>
<p>
	Using a basic AOP proxy technique, we can unobtrusively modifying the behaviour of module A so that module B responds directly to the invocation of <span class="code">A.updateModel</span>.
</p>

	<pre>
		<code class="coffeescript">oldUpdateModel = A.updateModel

A.updateModel = ->

	oldValue = oldUpdateModel.apply @, arguments

	B.updateModel.apply @, arguments

	oldValue

</code>
	</pre>

<p>
	Yet this convenience comes at a cost: The modules are no longer decoupled. A bridge between module A and module B now exists in one of module A&#39;s methods. In AOP terminology, the &ldquo;advice&rdquo; we have added to module A&#39;s method, is to invoke module B&#39;s method. Although the source code of module A is not modified, the advice still exists in the modules instance.
</p>
<h3>Proxy Pub-Sub Pattern</h3>
<p>
	Instead of adding advice to module A that couples the instance to module B, I suggest using AOP in a  &ldquo;pub-sub&rdquo; fashion, similar to events. Instead of publishing events to an events namespace,  &ldquo;publish&rdquo; and  &ldquo;subscribe&rdquo; methods to an events proxy object.
</p>

	<pre>
		<code class="coffeescript">newDataReceived = new ProxyLinker

newDataReceived.publish A.updateModel

newDataReceived.subscribe B.updateModel</code>
	</pre>

<p>

Because this pattern does not create any dependencies, the connections made with this &ldquo;linker&rdquo; should be contained in a separate file. This file can be discluded for unit testing of individual modules.
</p>


<p>
	This pattern offers a few benefits:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Each of the modules can be developed independently, and later linked together.</li>
	<li>Developers working on module A don&#39;t have to be aware that other modules rely on operations occuring in their module.</li>
	<li>A stack trace will trace errors from the source to the error destination.</li>

	<li>The source of the modules can remain uncluttered from subscriptions or publications.</li>
	<li>Unit tests can be made while testing the entire application object by simply removing the linker file.</li>
</ul>


<p>I wrote this article in to elaborate on some of the ideas introduced in John Hann&#39;s article, <a href="http://know.cujojs.com/blog/oop-is-not-my-hammer">&ldquo;OOP is not my hammer&rdquo;</a>.</p>
