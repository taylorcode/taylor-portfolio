<h3>First, a Little on Specifiers</h3>

<p>
It is a common pattern to require an <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=PXa2bby0oQ0C&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=object+specifiers+javascript&source=bl&ots=HIuimau_lC&sig=Cd2FUWZqCtE14fWXbWsiUnLqC9g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sPfrUtKeENKBogS4qoD4Cg&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=object%20specifiers%20javascript&f=false">object specifier</a> instead of parameters when creating a plugin or factory. Oftentimes the specifier is internally merged with a  &ldquo;defaults &rdquo; object and serves as settings for the plugins&#39; instance.</p>

<p>
Aside from providing syntactic clarity, object specifiers are useful in situations where there are optional parameters.
</p>

<pre>
  <code class="coffeescript">doSomething (param1, optionalParam2, param2) ->

doSomething 'my' undefined 'argument'</code>
</pre>

Alternatively, using a specifier:

<pre>
  <code class="coffeescript">doSomething (spec) ->

doSomething param1: 'my', param3: 'argument'</code>
</pre>

<p>They also eliminate the need to know the ordering of the parameters defined in the functions&#39; signature.</p>

<h3>Properties are Not Parameters</h3>
<p>
One drawback to using a specifier in place of parameters is that references to the properties are accessible outside of the scope of the invoked function. A copy of a reference to the specifier is passed into the function, resulting in a pass-by-reference effect for all of the primitive &ldquo;parameters&rdquo;:
</p>

<pre>
  <code class="coffeescript">catMaker = (spec) ->
  cat = {}
  cat.meow = ->
    alert spec.purr
    
  cat

catSpec = purr: "purrrrr"
myCat = catMaker(catSpec)
myCat.purr() # purrrrr
catSpec.purr = "bark!"
myCat.purr() # bark!</code>
</pre>

<p>
In this example, the behaviour of <span class="code">catMaker</span> is modified from the outside. Now, this is not necessarily bad, however. It is functionally dissimilar from parameters. A workaround for this is to cache references to the specifiers&#39; properties within the closure:
</p>

<pre>
  <code class="coffeescript">catMaker = (spec) ->
  cat = {}
  purr = spec.purr
  # ...code...</code>
</pre>

<p>
Although, this becomes rather tedious with several properties. Another thing that bothers me about this is that the specifier object is accessible to all methods we are attaching to the (plugins) instance. That feels messy. When the cat grows, you lose intellectual comprehension.
</p>
<h3>A Functional Approach, Enter Currying</h3>
<p>Ideally, every method of this instance would <strong>only have access to the properties from the specifier that it needs</strong>. One solution is to curry the functions, and define them in an outer scope:
</p>

<pre>
  <code class="coffeescript">catMaker = (->
  
  meowBuilder = (purr, volume) ->
    (name) ->
      log purr + ' I like to be pet by ' + name
      log 'purr volume: ' + volume
      
  (spec) ->
    cat = {}
    cat.meow = meowBuilder spec.purr spec.purrVolume
    cat
    
)()

jinxie = catMaker purr: 'purrrr...', purrVolume: 99, weight: 3</code>
</pre>

<p>
<span class="code">meowBuilder</span> does not have access to the specifier or the internal instance because it is defined outside of their scope. Furthermore, via the closure that is created, <span class="code">meowBuilder</span> has access to copies of the (primitive) arguments passed to it, instead of references to properties of the specifier object. Yay.<p>
