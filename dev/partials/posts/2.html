<h3>They're More Useful than You Thought</h3>
<p>Accessor properties were recently added to JavaScript and are gaining popularity in use. In the primitive examples, accessor properties appear as a convenient way to keep objects as opaque as the developer desires, while publishing dynamic value properties.</p>

<p>
After thinking about the possible use-case scenarios for accessor properties, I noticed that they alter a number of preexising paradigms of the syntax and semantics of JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
For example, assignments in JavaScript were formally always direct. After the introduction of setters, the assignment or access of a property may lead to an number of operations:</p>
    
<pre>
    <code class="coffeescript">dog.run = 'fast' #may result in a 3D dog
dog.run #may result in webworkers mining bitcoins</code>
</pre>

    
<p>
These special properties do have several use-case scenarios, that increase the readability, semantic clarity, and number of syntactic design options for developers.</p>
  

<h3>Chanining Methods</h3>  
<p>DOM manipulations are a thing of the past (that is of course, unless you are writing a framework). But consider the convenience of using accessor properties to chain methods:

<pre>
    <code class="coffeescript">myList.parent.siblings.first.html 'Hello there'</code>
</pre>

<p>
The access of each of the properties invokes their getter function, which performs the normal operations of DOM tree traversals that the equivalent function properties performed.
</p>

<p>
Under the old pre-accessor paradigm, every property accessed here appears as a property of the parent object. The new semantic implications are the same as the implications of the syntax with function properties:
</p>
<pre>
    <code class="coffeescript">myList.parent().siblings().first().remove()</code>
</pre>
<p>
With one exception: no parameters can be passed to the method. IMO, this limitation actually provides semantic clarity: Because no parameters are possible, the function of the accessor and it's capabilities are simplified.
</p>


<p>A simplified implementation displays this possibility:</p>

</p>
<pre>
    <code class="html">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;a id=&quot;nested-child&quot;&gt;I'm nested!&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code>
</pre>


<pre>
    <code class="html">Object.defineProperty $.fn, 'parentLink',
  get: ->
    @parent()

$('#nested-child').parentLink.css 'background', 'blue'</code>
</pre>

<p>Properties can now be used to create complex connections between objects that make semantically sense.<p>

<h3>Accessor Properties for Testing Libraries</h3>

<p>Libraries such as Jasmine aim to create the most readable and concise syntax for testing JavaScript. Accessor properties can help to eliminate complex inheritance schemes and meaningless syntax.</p>

<p>Consider this rudimentary implementation of the toEqual method:</p>
<pre>
    <code class="coffeescript">testProtoInstance =
  toEqual: (val) ->
    return true  if @val is val #some complex check
    false

  not:
    toEqual: ->
      not @toEqual.apply this, arguments

expect = (val) ->
  tester = Object.create testProtoInstance
  tester.not.toEqual = tester.not.toEqual.bind tester
  tester.val = val
  tester</code>
</pre>

<pre>
    <code class="coffeescript">console.log expect(5).toEqual 5 # true
console.log expect(5).not.toEqual 5 # false</code>
</pre>

<p>The goal here is of course to allow the <span class="code">toEqual</span> method of the nested <span class="code">not</span> object to simply negate the value returned from the outer object's <span class="code">toEqual</span> method. Unfortunately, this was not straightforward to achieve:</p>

<p>The context of <span class="code">not.toEqual</span> upon invocation is the <span class="code">not</span> object. Therefore, in order to gain access to the instance from within <span class="code">not.toEqual</span>, we are forced to manually bind a new context through reassignment:</p>

<pre>
    <code class="coffeescript">tester.not.toEqual = tester.not.toEqual.bind tester</code>
</pre>

<p>Another solution that will allow access to the instance from any method relys on additional boilerplate to create a closure that traps a reference to the instance as a private variable.</p>

<pre>
	<code class="coffeescript">testProtoInstance = (->
  instance = undefined
  toEqual: (val) ->
    return true  if @val is val
    false

  not:
    toEqual: ->
      not instance.toEqual.apply instance, arguments

  init: ->
    instance = this
)()

expect = (val) ->
  tester = undefined
  tester = Object.create testProtoInstance
  tester.init()
  tester.val = val
  tester</code>
</pre>

<p>
In both cases, architectural simplicity was traded for syntactic and semantic simpicity.</p>

<h3>Don't Make the Trade</h3>

<p>Fortunately we can define a getter for the <span class="code">not</span> property, to retain the semantic clarity of a value property and the architectural simplicity of a method.</p>

<pre>
	<code class="javascript">var testProtoInstance = {
    state: true,
    toEqual: function (val) {
        if (this.val === val) {
            return this.state;
        }
        return !this.state;
    },
    get not() {
        this.state = !this.state;
        return this;
    }
}, expect = function (val) {
    var tester = Object.create(testProtoInstance);
    tester.val = val;
    return tester;
};</code>
</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, coffeescript does not yet support the convenient accessor property syntax for prototypes.</p>

<p>Now that not behaves like a method, I chose to create a flag property <span class="code">state</span> to indicate that the result of sebsequent tests should be negated.<p>
