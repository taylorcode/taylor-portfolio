<h3>Know When to Use Them</h3>

<p>
It is a common pattern to require an <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=PXa2bby0oQ0C&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=object+specifiers+javascript&source=bl&ots=HIuimau_lC&sig=Cd2FUWZqCtE14fWXbWsiUnLqC9g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sPfrUtKeENKBogS4qoD4Cg&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=object%20specifiers%20javascript&f=false">object specifier</a> instead of parameters when creating a plugin or factory. Oftentimes the specifier is internally merged with a  &ldquo;defaults &rdquo; object and serves as settings for the plugins&#39; instance.</p>

<p>
Aside from providing syntactic clarity, object specifiers are useful in situations where there are optional arguments.
</p>

<pre>
  <code class="coffeescript">doSomething (param1, param2, param2) ->

doSomething 'my' undefined 'argument'</code>
</pre>

Alternatively, using a specifier:

<pre>
  <code class="coffeescript">doSomething (spec) ->

doSomething param1: 'my', param2: 'argument'</code>
</pre>

<p>They also eliminate the need to know the ordering of the parameters defined in the functions&#39; signature.</p>

<h3>Properties are Not Parameters</h3>
<p>
One drawback to using a specifier in place of parameters is that references to the properties are accessible outside of the scope of the invoked function. A copy of a reference to the specifier is passed into the function, resulting in a pass-by-reference effect for all of the primitive &ldquo;parameters&rdquo;:
</p>

<pre>
  <code class="coffeescript">catMaker = (spec) ->
  cat = {}
  cat.meow = ->
    alert spec.purr
    
  cat

catSpec = purr: "purrrrr"
myCat = catMaker(catSpec)
myCat.purr() # purrrrr
catSpec.purr = "bark!"
myCat.purr() # bark!</code>
</pre>

<p>
In this example, the behaviour of <span class="code">catMaker</span> is modified from the outside. Now, this is not necessarily bad, however. It is functionally dissimilar from parameters. A workaround for this is to cache references to the specifiers&#39; properties within the closure:
</p>

<pre>
  <code class="coffeescript">catMaker = (spec) ->
  cat = {}
  purr = spec.purr
  # ...code...</code>
</pre>

<p>
Although, this becomes rather tedious with several properties. 
</p>

<h3>Function Parameter Delegation</h3>
<p>
Another issue is that the specifier object is accessible to all methods that are attached to the (plugins) instance. <strong>Ideally, every method would only have access to the properties it needs.</strong> The follow example addresses these two issues:
</p>

<pre>
  <code class="coffeescript">catMaker = (->
  
  meowBuilder = (purr, volume) ->
    (name) ->
      log purr + ' I like to be pet by ' + name
      log 'purr volume: ' + volume
      
  (spec) ->
    cat = {}
    cat.meow = meowBuilder spec.purr spec.purrVolume
    cat
    
)()

jinxie = catMaker purr: 'purrrr...', purrVolume: 99, weight: 3</code>
</pre>

<p>
<span class="code">meowBuilder</span> does not have access to the specifier or the internal instance because it is defined outside of their scope. Furthermore, via the closure that is created, <span class="code">meowBuilder</span> has access to copies of the primitives passed to it, instead of references to properties of the specifier object.<p>

This pattern is particularly useful in my opinion when creating large libraries or plugins where encapsulation and limiting scope are especially important.</p>
