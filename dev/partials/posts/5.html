AOP proxies as a replacement for internal callbacks

Callbacks are messy.

What is a callback API? A convoluted peice of code.

Every plugin should return a proxy object:

var pluginInstance = $('#myElem').plugin();

var pluginProxy = proxy(pluginInstance);

pluginProxy.after('onSwipeLeft', function (arguments) {

});


They introduce static into gravure because its hard to get the ink out of the highlight cells.
  Surface area of ink rises up with static
  Problem = occurs in bindery

Fewer suppliers = less competition

Lithography doens't care - because its all flat

Acid
  Make the cells bigger
  Tape the area you don't want bigger

CONS
Fewer paper suppliers for gravure

Physical location of plants
  Most back east, in population centers
  Reno is the closest one to us
  Hard to put one in gravure - california laws

Make ink less vicsious = decrease color
  More viscous = more color slightly
  Problem: Adjustment occurs globally

Impression pressure - adjust color

Angle of doctor blade - adjust angle - adjust amount of ink

How is it a flying splice - bigger surface area - hope that it sticks to the web
  
Shorter length of runs on Gravure are becoming more common

Gravure - Typically one wide web - divided up

Why can you get greater shadows?
  Gravure has a 3d image - better solid color
  It dry traps
    So you can put down more ink on top


    Why reproduce better on crummy paper?
      No water

  Multiple heads - more engraving time
    Every single head must be able to reproduce the same size cells
    Don't want color variation across the page

Gravure
  Everything is screened

  Gravure - not as good as lithography on highlights

  Low-key images
    Lots of shadows

  Why do is black important
    You print text
    Make cells smaller - tighter together = jagged edge less visible
